# This is the Anki deck of the B1 german word list by Goethe Institut **[(1)](https://www.goethe.de/pro/relaunch/prf/en/Goethe-Zertifikat_B1_Wortliste.pdf)**.

### It includes:
- 5740 Cards (Includign Reverse Cards)
- 2870 Total Words
- 1499 Nouns
- 651 Verbs (with prepositions and their case where appropriate)
- 720 Adjectives, Adverbs, prepositions etc.
- 4589 Example Sentences with Audio

### How It Was Made:
1. Having found an already processed list of the words and their example sentences **[(2)](https://wejn.org/2023/12/extracting-data-from-goethe-zertifikat-b1-wortliste/#solution)**, I sorted them into three categories: Nouns, Verbs and Other.
2. With the use of the DeepL translation API, I translated the words and their example sentences into english.
3. I hand checked the meanings of each word and corrected them where necessary; I also added a note for each prepositional verb with its preposition and case **[(3)](http://deutsch.ie/german-grammar/german-exercises/german-verbs/game-verbs-with-prepositions)**.
4. I sorted the words by a german words by frequency list I found on github **[(4)](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords/blob/master/content/2018/de/de_50k.txt)**.
5. I imported the CSV files into Anki and bulk generated the audio with the AwesomeTTS plug-in.

**Notes:** The "B1_goethe" note type used in the deck has a "notes" field where you can write a personal note or hint for any flashcard.
