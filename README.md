# This is the Anki deck of the B1 german word list by Goethe Institut **(1)**.

### It includes:

- 2870 Total Words
- 1499 Nouns
- 651 Verbs (with prepositions and their case where appropriate)
- 720 Adjectives, Adverbs, prepositions etc.
- 4589 Example Sentences with Audio

### How It Was Made:

1. Having found an already processed list of the words and their example sentences **(2)**, I sorted them into three categories: Nouns, Verbs and Other.
2. With the use of the DeepL translation API, I translated the words and their example sentences into english.
3. I hand checked the meanings of each word and corrected them where necessary; I also added a note for each prepositional verb with its preposition and case **(3)**.
4. I sorted the words by a german words by frequency list I found on github **(4)**.
5. I imported the CSV files into Anki and bulk generated the audio with the AwesomeTTS plug-in.

### Notes: the "B1_goethe" note type used in the deck has a "notes" field where you can write a personal note or hint for any flashcard.
